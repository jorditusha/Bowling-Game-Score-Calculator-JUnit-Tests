# Bowling Game Score Calculator

This Java project provides a `BowlingGame` class that calculates the score of a bowling game based on the input provided in the format of `"[n,n][n,n]..[n,n]"`, where each pair of numbers represents the number of pins knocked down in each frame. The project also includes unit tests to ensure the correctness of the `BowlingGame` class.

## Running Tests

The project includes JUnit tests to ensure the correctness of the `BowlingGame` class. To run the tests:

1. Navigate to the test package in your IDE.
2. Run the `BowlingGameTest` class.

## Unit Test Coverage

The unit tests cover various scenarios including:

- Minimum score (all frames have no pins knocked down).
- Maximum score (all frames have 9 pins knocked down in the first roll).
- Different combinations of open frames, strikes, and spares.
- Handling edge cases such as incorrect input formats and missing bonus rounds.
